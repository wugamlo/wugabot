                          content: The sky appears blue because of the way Earth's atmosphere scatters
                            sunlight. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere,
                            it is made up of various colors of the spectrum, but
                            blue light waves are shorter and scatter more easily
                            when they hit the gases and particles in the
                            atmosphere. This scattering occurs in all
                            directions, but from our perspective on the ground,
                            it appears as a blue hue that dominates the sky's
                            color. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh
                            scattering. During sunrise and sunset, the sunlight
                            has to travel further through the atmosphere, which
                            allows more time for the blue light to scatter away
                            from our direct line of sight, leaving the longer
                            wavelengths, such as red, yellow, and orange, to
                            dominate the sky's color.
