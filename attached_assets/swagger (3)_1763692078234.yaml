                              In this article we'll look at the science behind
                              why the sky is blue, or at least why it appears
                              blue to our eyes.


                              A beautiful blue sky is the sign of a pleasant day
                              ahead. But what makes the sky appear blue?


                              So, the sky appears blue because the molecules of
                              nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere scatter
                              light in short wavelengths towards the blue end of
                              the visible spectrum.

                              first found an explanation for why the sky is
                              blue: Blue light from the Sun is scattered the
                              most when it passes through the atmosphere.

                              The answer has to do with molecules.


                              It was around 1870 when the British physicist John
                              William Strutt, better known as Lord Rayleigh,

                              When the Sun is near the horizon, its light passes
                              through a lot more of the atmosphere to reach the
                              Earth’s surface than when it is directly overhead.
                              The blue and green light is scattered so well that
                              you can hardly see it. The sky is colored,
                              instead, with red and orange light.
